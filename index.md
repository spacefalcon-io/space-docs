[Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/trade/FCON-USDT)|[Gate](https://www.gate.io/trade/FCON_USDT)|[Raydium](https://raydium.io/swap/?from=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v&to=HovGjrBGTfna4dvg6exkMxXuexB3tUfEZKcut8AWowXj)

After you successfully purchased FCON on any exchange you need to transfer your FCON into the wallet such as Phantom, Solflare or Sollet and connect to the website.

##### $FCON Staking Pools
```sh
FCON-7D: Your funds in this pool will be fully locked for 7 days.
FCON-60D: Your funds in this pool will be fully locked for 60 days.
```

##### $FCON Staking Rewards 
The whole $FCON staking rewards system is based on actual TVL (total value locked) in the chosen pool. If TVL is higher, APR (annual percentage rate) is lower and vice versa. You can find TVL and all available pools on this [link](www.spacefalcon.io/staking).

Complete guideline on "How to stake $FCON" you can find [here](https://spacefalconio.medium.com/space-falcon-is-thrilled-to-announce-that-fcon-staking-pools-are-live-1be21ac10c0f)

## $FGOLD:
$FCON will serve as secondary currency and the native in-game token within the Space Falcon metaverse. It will be required for gaming actions such as spaceship repairs, refuelling, advanced weapons purchasing, equipment replacement, and cosmos tax payment. Also, the tokens will be the predominant means of exchange within the NFT marketplace which means that every holder will be able to purchase other project‚Äôs virtual assets with $FGOLD.

Players looking to earn on Space Falcon will need to prioritise how much $FGOLD they use within the metaverse and how much they can make with their time. The unit of exchange can be used to purchase assets or items from company vendors or directly from a player (peer-to-peer). Asset types include novelty for spaceship equipment, fuel and weapons.

## NFTs:
Decentralised gaming provides gamers with what they truly need, a structure that rewards them for doing what they love. Rather than the lopsided zero benefits characteristic of centralised gaming platforms, decentralised gaming is built on transparency, fairness, and immutability. In Space Falcon, NFT items can be traded in and out of the game‚Äôs ecosystem. Or it can be staked, lent, or borrowed for rewards.

The sheer thought of exchanging your gaming character for some SOL should have you turning in your chair. Overall the most significant benefit NFT game assets bring is that they allow players to retain their investments in value (and money).

One exciting use of this arrangement is that NFT game assets can go beyond their initial use plan. Their inceptive use was to take on an entirely new life within the metaverse.

## NFT Staking
Space Falcon NFT holders will be able to stake their NFTs in almost the same principle as $FCON stakers.The rewards are different though. Our project uses a dual-token mechanism which means that we have more than one official token in our ecosystem. $FGOLD will be distributed to all NFT stakers after the staking period ends. After that you‚Äôll be able to exchange it to $FCON or USDC. The rewards will multiply by the number of NFTs the holders want to stake. 

## Game:
Space Falcon takes virtual assets a step further with the introduction of planets, spaceships and galaxies. Players who own our NFTs will be able to literally control what they buy, sell or craft in the game which opens the door to infinite scalability. Players can socialise with each other and have fun while playing the game along with  planning your next steps towards a successful investment, so making a common aim for everyone is critical for us to achieve that. Our mission is to implement collections of customizable assets in the metaverse to make the gaming experience highly engaging. 

By collecting crystals in the game, players can level-up their spaceships, upgrade their spaceships, buying meele guns and basically everything what makes them stronger and their spaceship more powerfull in the game. Players can collecting crystal by playing P2E (play to earn) mode where each takedown, kill or 1st place in the battle royale give them certain amount of Crystals. Crystals are easily tradable for FGOLD straight in the game. 

## Launchpad

Overall of 8 staking tiers, 7 tiers are granted for FCON stakes and 1 tier (Galaxy Explorers) for NFT stakes. All of the tiers have 2 different time spans for locked staking. To enter a certain pool, investors will have to pass the requirements for them to be able to get in. Every pool showcases the minimum amount you have to hold in order to be able to stake in that specific pool. Also, the rewards for each tier are being displayed on the 7D and 60D pools. It goes without saying that if you lock your tokens for a longer period of time, you'll get a much bigger allocation.

## How to participate in IDO on the Space Falcon launchpad:

Space Falcon is a Next-generation platform with an Ecosystem launcher that uses Initial Decentralized Offerings, or IDOs, to connect major projects with early community members. In exchange for funding, a project will give tokens to community members (called IDO participants) during an IDO. As a result, projects are able to generate funds and expand their communities, while participants gain access to (very) early access to high-potential tokens. Many people want to be involved in IDOs, yet there isn't enough space for everyone. As a result, taking part in an IDO successfully necessitates a few actions in advance to assure fairness and security.

Step 1: Discover upcoming IDO The easiest way to find out all the details about the launching project, vesting schedule, supply, total raise, etc.. is on our official website. We are also attaching the project's social media links and through them, you can find the rest of the information.

Step 2: Whitelist Before every IDO event on Falcon Launch, we will post on our social media (follow links below) the IDO whitelist event. Being whitelisted means that you can participate in IDO without staking FCON or NFT. Only 100 participants will be chosen with the max allocation of 20 USDC. More details will be shared in the IDO whitelist event.

Step 3: Stake your FCON tokens and NFTs to get access to participate in IDO on Falcon Launch, in case you do not have the whitelist. You can stake Space Falcon governance token $FCON or NFTs from collection Space Falcon: Chapter 1. Links, where you can buy tokens or NFTs will be attached at the end of this article along with other links. On how to stake FCON and NFT you can find in the dedicated article here (link on staking once an article is out) 

Step 4: KYC The next step to participating in IDO is to make sure you complete KYC on our platform. You only ever need to KYC once, but you will be unable to participate in any raises until you do. You will be unable to participate in our sales as well if you are a U.S. person, a People's Republic of China person, an Ontario State of Canada person, and all U.N. sanctions list person. 

Step 5: Participation in the IDO Once KYC is completed, participants need to wait for the launch date and time of the IDO. IDOs are first come, first serve. It is up to the projects to determine how much their total raise is, and depending on that number, your chances of successfully participating in an IDO may be higher or lower. Make sure you keep in your wallet USDC in order to claim your tokens and roughly 0.1SOL to pay all necessary gas fees.

## Why Space Falcon prefers the Solana Ecosystem
Solana launched the first ever ‚Äúweb-scale blockchain‚Äù in 2019 making it the only blockchain solution capable of hosting applications with the computational bandwidth akin to the modern internet, presenting the capability to power decentralized versions of Nasdaq, Facebook, Twitter and all other existing blockchains. 

Selecting Solana was an obvious choice due to its processing capabilities of 50,000+ transactions per second at sub-second finality and average transaction costs of only $0.00001. Such performance at the blockchain layer enables a future in which all game logic can be computed on a suite of on-chain smart applications.

Solana is a layer 1, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain with a pBFT-derived consensus mechanism and 200 nodes operating around the world, offering support for 50,000 transactions per second (TPS) speed. Solana achieves such strong performance via a set of coordinated optimizations. Transactions are also processed in parallel by GPU hardware natively, which is a first for blockchains. Previously, all blockchains were single-threaded ‚Äî Solana is the only blockchain that is multi-threaded.
